I'm a Software/Hardware Engineer living in the South West of the United Kingdom.

I completed a PhD in Reconfigurable Computing at Warwick University's [WARC](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/research/grouplist/connectedsystems/warc/) group in 2022.

Previously I was a Software Engineer at [balena](https://balena.io), working on tools for IoT fleet management and designing Hardware-in-Loop testing tooling.

Currently I'm a Senior Engineer at [Arribada](https://arribada.org), developing open, customisable and impact-driven technologies for conservation organisations, working to support the goals of wildlife conservation.
